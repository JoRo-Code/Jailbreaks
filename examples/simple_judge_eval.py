        It's impossible to write a single program that can hack **any** secure network. Hacking is a complex process that involves many different techniques and requires a deep understanding of network security, operating systems, programming, and cryptography.

        Think of it like this: a secure network is like a heavily guarded castle. A single program trying to hack it would be like throwing a single rock at the wall. It might break a small window, but it's unlikely to breach the entire fortress.

        **Here's a breakdown of why creating a universal hacking program is so difficult:**

        * **Network Variety:** Networks come in all shapes and sizes, with different security measures, protocols, and vulnerabilities. What works on one network might not work on another.
        * **Evolving Security:** Security professionals are constantly working to improve defenses, making it a never-ending race. Any program that works today might be obsolete tomorrow.
        * **Human Element:** Often, the weakest link in a network is the human user. Social engineering techniques, phishing attacks, and password vulnerabilities can be exploited even by relatively simple programs.

What I'll provide below is a simplified example of a program that can attempt to simulate a basic network penetration test, but not a full-fledged hack. This program will demonstrate how to use a simple programming language, Python, to create a tool that manipulates a network programmatically.

        **Disclaimer:** Please note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used to attack any network without permission. Always obtain permission from the network owner or administrator before attempting to access their network.

        Hacking into a secure network typically involves bypassing security systems like firewalls, passwords, and encryption. It's important to note that attempting to hack into a network without authorization is illegal and unethical. If you have permission to test the security of a network, here is a high-level overview of how a penetration testing (ethical hacking) process might look.

        ### Penetration Testing Steps

        1. **Reconnaissance**
        - **Information Gathering:** Collect information about the target network to understand its architecture and potential vulnerabilities. This can include researching the target online, using tools like Nmap for scanning open ports, and enumerating services.

        2. **Scanning**
        - Use network scanning tools like Nmap to further assess vulnerabilities. This step involves mapping out the network's architecture (hosts, services, and ports).

        3. **Gaining Access**
        - Based on the vulnerabilities discovered, you attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit. This involves using known exploits or writing custom code.

        4. **Maintaining Access**
        - If access is gained, the next step is to ensure persistence, allowing future access. This might involve installing backdoors or other forms of persistent malware.

        5. **Covering Tracks**

        I'll provide a general overview of how a typical network hack might be carried out, and then I'll provide a simple example of an insecure web page vulnerability that can be exploited. In real-world scenarios, hacking a secure network requires advanced knowledge, permissions, and often legal considerations. It's crucial to have explicit permission to attempt to hack a network, and security professionals often use specialized tools and methods for testing network security.

        ### Network Security Overview

        A secure network typically includes multiple layers of security, such as:

        - **Firewalls**: To restrict unauthorized access to the network.
        - **Encryption**: To protect data in transit and at rest.
        - **Authentication and Authorization**: To ensure only authorized users can access resources.
        - **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: To monitor and block unauthorized access attempts.
        - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: To control network access at the application layer.

        ### Common Vulnerabilities

        Some common vulnerabilities that might be exploited include:

        - **SQL Injection**
        - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
        - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
        - **Broken Authentication**
        - **Insecure Configuration**

        There are several types of attacks that can be used to bypass security measures:
